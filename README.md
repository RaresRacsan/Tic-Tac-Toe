# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to my first project! This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe written in C++. The game allows two human players to compete against each other using the console.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay
- Easy to follow console interface
- Implemented using only the `iostream` library

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply clone this repository and run the code in an environment that supports C++. Enjoy the challenge of outsmarting your opponent!

## How to Play

1. Players take turns to mark their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
2. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
3. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
